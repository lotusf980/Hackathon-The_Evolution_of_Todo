# Prompt
```
Create a constitution for the The Evolution of Todo project based on the project requirements.
```

# Response
```
I've created the constitution for your "The Evolution of Todo" project at .specify/memory/constitution.md. The constitution includes:

1. Core Principles:
   - Spec-Driven Development: Following the SDD methodology (Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement)
   - AI-Agent First Development: All code must be generated via Claude Code using Spec-Kit Plus
   - Progressive Architecture Evolution: Adhering to the 5-phase evolution plan
   - Test-First Implementation: Following TDD principles throughout development
   - Reusable Intelligence & Modularity: Designing for reusability and loose coupling
   - Security-First Approach: Incorporating security from initial design

2. Technical Constraints: Defining the technology stack for each phase

3. Development Workflow: Establishing proper spec-driven processes

4. Governance: Setting rules for compliance and project management

This constitution establishes the foundational principles that will guide your entire hackathon project.
